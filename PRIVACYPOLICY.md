# General Information
Here is additional information to help you understand how Alexa skills work. Information adopted from [here](https://petsymposium.org/2017/papers/hotpets/amazon-alexa-skills-ecosystem-privacy.pdf).

Audio availability: Although users interact with Skills using voice commands, the audio is not made accessible to the developers. Instead, all voice commands are transcribed and sent to the developers as text. This design choice by Amazon has several privacy benefits: first, Skill developers cannot create a unique user fingerprint using the rich audio data. Second, the voice data cannot be used to infer user’s age, gender, emotional state, etc., unless this information is explicitly conveyed in the choice of vocabulary (e.g., using gendered verbs and expletives).

userId: The userId is a unique identifier given by Amazon to each user. Amazon assigns a different userId for each Skill used so the userId’s usefulness for cross-Skill tracking is limited. This userID can be reset by disabling and re-enabling a skill.

Permissions: Developers can configure their Skill to request access to the address of the user’s device at the “Full Address” or “Country & Postal Code Only” levels. Developers can also configure a skill to read and write to user’s Alexa lists, such as shopping or to-do. A user enabling such a Skill is prompted for consent with a permissions card in the Alexa app. List permissions apply to all of the user’s lists. Permissions can be revoked in the Skills section of the Alexa app.
