## Inspiration

**Where did the idea come from?**

For a Life Hack and Work-at-Home Skill, we did not want to reinvent the calendar/day view, timer/time manager, alarm, and calling features Alexa already supports natively. Instead we choose to address **four major, important, and relevant issues to today: cybersecurity, information security, security vulnerabilities, and bugs.**

We realized that there were very few skills for [security researchers](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dalexa-skills&field-keywords=Hacker) and [developers](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dalexa-skills&field-keywords=Developer) after meeting with the principal engineer and the community manager at BugCrowd at Los Altos Hacks III. They challenged us to create a skill that would a) inform them of active bug bounties, b) provide details about the specific bounties, and c) make their lives as security researchers easier in any other way.

**What motivated you?**

We wanted to tap the [over 166,000](https://www.hackerone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/2018_Hacker_Report.pdf) registered ethical hackers on HackerOne (as of December 2017) and the [over 80,400](https://bugcrowd.com/programs) registered security researchers on BugCrowd and hundreds of thousands of developers who do not have many skills meant to help them with their work from home or programming passions. We also wanted to make the skill applicable to the general public.

These are the crowdsourced heroes who help keep our data safe. **One thing we hate the most** is losing our precious data to black hat hackers or cyber criminals as a result of undiscovered security vulnerabilities. Companies such as Facebook could have benefitted from larger exposure to their existing bug bounty programs or new bug bounty programs. **This is where our skill comes in, it gives larger exposure to public bug bounty programs with an emphasis on new ones.**

## Mission

**Why bug bounties?**

A large part of our days now revolve around devices and being connected to the internet. Customers have come to expect security and confidence in the company handling their data. Even the best developers in the world can leave security vulnerabilities open in their applications. Platforms such as BugCrowd and HackerOne make it easier for security researchers to get connected with companies and allow companies to reach a vast network of researchers. Breaches and security vulnerabilities are expensive to recover from, much more expensive than the few-thousand-dollar reward hackers receive for their finding(s). Facebook, Equifax, Intel, 24/7 AI, eBay, Home Depot, Target, and a handful of other companies have experienced security breaches as a result of vulnerabilities exploited by black hat hackers and their reputations have suffered as a result.

## Use Cases
*Who is this Alexa skill for?*

1. **General Public** - *All customers and clients value their private data. As such, they expect the company entrusted with their data to do everything in their power to protect that data. Now more than ever, breaches of customer data are a common occurrence. Users should not, however, become desensitized or numb to such news but rather proactively take action to protect their data.* - Bug Browser can help anyone keep up-to-date on the latest news about security vulnerabilities, hacks, and other cybersecurity issues.

  - **How does this skill provide convenience, save time, and improve the lives of the general public?**
    - Bug Browser provides focused news on the topic of cybersecurity and a list of security breaches. In today's fast paced news cycle, not everyone in the public is made aware of hacks and vulnerabilities that affect them.
    - Bug Browser can also check for security breaches that may have resulted in a users data being lost by getting a users email from account linking. Users who learn they are affected by a security breach through Bug Browser can then take proactive steps to prevent further losses by changing their password, freezing their credit reports, activating identity protection services, canceling their credit cards, updating their computer or device software, and/or using 2-factor authentication which Bug Browser can teach users about.    - Bug Browser ultimately can save the general public from the headaches of recovering lost accounts and data, reversing unauthorized transactions, and more.

2. **Developers** - *Developers who have experience with code, computers, and other fields of computer science but are not focused on hacking, cybersecurity, or security research as a career or hobby* - Bug Browser can introduce developers to the importance of bug bounties and bug bounty platforms.

  - **How does this skill provide convenience, save time, and improve the lives of developers?**
    - Bug Browser has overview videos and descriptions to get developers hooked on the lifestyle that is security research. Bug Browser will walk developers through the reasons bug bounty programs exist, how they can join bug bounty platforms, and set them on their way to being a novice hacker. Bug Browser effectively exposes developers to new ways to apply their existing interests and knowledge of computer science including to develop and defeat new security techniques and find strengths and weaknesses in code.
    - Bug Browser also has a list developers can quickly access to understand HTTP Status codes. These status are standard codes for communicating between network requests but there are so many that its hard to remember which means what. It is crucial to know what these codes mean when analyzing server-client interactions. Bug Browser can list 62 standard HTTP status codes with ease.
      - Example: `200  OK`
    - Developers can ask Bug Browser to search for a specific bug they find in their code or programs. Using the power of Bing Cognitive Services Search API and StackExchange API, Bug Browser will return the top answer from a StackOverflow thread. Developers can use this feature when their compilers do not provide enough information about how to fix the issue, to jog their memory, or to learn about bugs they have never seen before. StackOverflow is equipped to handle the most complex of questions about development.

3. **New and Intermediate Hackers** - *Hackers who are just starting their career or hobby in security research will not have the coding experience to find bugs immediately but have enough of an understanding of code, computers, web development, server-side scripting, hardware, networking, operating systems, etcetera to learn how to hack. These hackers are likely developers looking to make additional money or improve their own skills* - Bug Browser provides tutorials for how to hack for people with basic experience and understanding in the world of computers including application and development of software in C++, C, or Python, as well as experience developing software applications in Linux, Mac OS, and/or Windows environments. Novice hackers can listen to the descriptions or watch the videos in the background while they work on other tasks.

- **How does this skill provide convenience, save time, and improve the lives of novice hackers?**
  - Bug Browser can describe specific vulnerabilities, how to find security flaws, and explain how to get paid with bug bounties. Whether users are interested in learning about bug bounties, have a background in computer science, or are seasoned security professionals, they can learn something from Bug Browsers library of lessons (powered by [Hacker101](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/hacker101)).

4. **Active Security Researchers** - *Security researchers do not work your typical 9-to-5 workday. People in this field do not have to have a college diploma or a certification to do it, just a good understanding of programming, computers, and hardware. Security research can be challenging but very rewarding. Ethical hackers protect companies, organizations, and institutions from abuse from malicious hackers. These ethical hackers gain anything from points on the platform to monetary rewards.* - Security researchers can ask about active programs, get more details about these programs, and refer back to the skill for updates and new programs daily. We can reach the [over 166,000](https://www.hackerone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/2018_Hacker_Report.pdf) registered ethical hackers on HackerOne (as of December 2017) and the [over 80,400](https://bugcrowd.com/programs) registered security researchers on BugCrowd in addition to the developer and general public audiences.

- **How does this skill provide convenience, save time, and improve the lives of security researchers?**
  - Security researchers often work on their own schedule and have flexible hours. Alexa can simplify the process of learning of new programs (list sorted by NEWEST first) from various platforms.
  - Once they find a few programs they like, security researchers can ask Alexa to add the programs to their list so they can keep track of the bounties they want to participate in from **all platforms in one place**. They can do all of this from their Echo Spot, Echo Show, Fire TV, Dash Wand, Alexa App, Fire TV, and/or other Alexa-enabled devices.

## Skill Development Cycle

**What was challenging during the development process?**

Our team faced several major challenges during the development cycle:

**1. Implementing a Graphical User Interface / Display Interface**

When we started the skill we had not even thought about users who had displays like those on the Echo Spot and Echo Show as well as cards on the Fire TV and Alexa app. One of the goals we set for ourselves was to implement a GUI for Bug Browser and design the best user experience possible. Frequently referring to Amazon's resources and documentation for building user interfaces, we were able to quickly learn the differences between the templates. The next step in the development process was to find the most effective method of building a template. We had trouble implementing the display interfaces initially but soon became experts at using them after learning how to use the standard template builder methods included in the SDK for Lambda. While adding support for templates, we found it difficult to read text over certain images. In order to solve this problem, we added a darker gradient to the images so the text overlay would be more visible.

**2. Asynchronous Requests**

From the early stages of Bug Browser, our team had agreed on a few basic design principles that would increase the efficiency and reliability of Bug Browser. One of the most important of these principles was the use of asynchronous request for HTTP GET requests because it is the best practice to avoid blocking the main thread whenever possible. We used the request-promise Node.js module for writing asynchronous requests that would retrieve image assets, JSON, and other data that would be parsed with the Cheerio module for Node.js.

**3. Context**

Alexa is a smart, conversational AI that, just like any human being, needs context in order to interpret speech and respond to a user query. Not only does Alexa require context, but it also needs to be able to remember session details that would help with routing requests to the correct destination. We implemented a system of context organization that would be able to determine the last intent a user was routed to and used it for page navigation between programs lists and program pages as well as news lists and news pages.

For example, if a user asks for *"number one"* that could either mean a HackerOne program, a BugCrowd program, or a lesson number. Session-level attributes help us know what the user wants without forcing them to be more specific.

**4. Touch Interactions**

To improve user experience we enabled touch interactions using `ElementSelected` for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices. While this could not be tested from the simulator, we had our own touch-enabled Echo devices to test from. We felt binding a GUI touch event to an intent or function was crucial to user experience when additional information could also be requested by voice. Some of the most important uses for ElementSelected were for retrieving more information about both active programs and for seeing more information about a news article.

**5. Voice Interactions**

To improve user experience we enabled intents such as `AMAZON.RepeatIntent` should a user want to repeat an intent. Bug Browser's users can often be simultaneously working on important tasks, such as researching security flaws on a BugCrowd or HackerOne bounty, while using Bug Browser to retrieve more information about these bounties so we made sure to provide convenient intents for our users.

**6. Reducing Response Time**

Bug Browser consumes several APIs in order to provide users with accurate and reliable information. One of the challenges that came with developing an API consuming application was ensuring that Bug Browser was responsive and usable without making the user wait too long for a response. One of the ways we achieved this goal was using using [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) to run several API calls in parallel. In order to mitigate the latency when consuming APIs, we heavily employed the use of an advanced caching system that uses AWS Lambda and S3 storage. We developed new accelerated Lambda functions specifically designed for caching with S3 storage. These functions periodically retrieve data from the APIs Bug Browser uses and stores them in S3 objects (JSON format) in an S3 bucket. The advantages of developing a cache system with AWS Lambda, AWS S3 Object Storage, and AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration are very noticeable because the latency for some API responses have dropped from as much as over 4900ms to just under 200ms. User experience was one of our primary concerns and we made sure to do our best to make Bug Browser feel great for everyday use.

**7. Testing**

To ensure a flawless user experience regardless of the user device, we used virtual simulators for the Echo Show, our own Echo Spots, Amazon Apps with Alexa built-in, Dash Wands, and Echo Dots. Because Bug Browser has over 50 intents, we set aside a significant amount of time for the testing of each intent and used AWS CloudWatch logs to quickly find any issues. We kept on testing Bug Browser until we couldn't find any bugs.
